    "Car accidents can lead to injury or even death. Analyzing car accident data to learn what factors can influence the likelihood of a car accident can help drivers feel safer on the roads. Driving at night, due to factors including alcohol consumption, higher speeds, and tiredness, can cause potentially dangerous driving conditions [1]. Weather changes, such as rain, can cause hazardous road conditions that increase the likeihood of a car crash. If we can find a relationship between how weather and time of day factor into a car crash, and the frequency of accidents, it can help give California drivers insight into when to be more cautious or to avoid driving. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Why California?\n",
    "\n",
    "As students at university in California, we wanted to find if there was a specific time or weather condition that predicts the likelihood of a car accident on roads on which we personally drive. California's main mode of transportation is vehicles and thus there is a lot of car crash data. California does not have too much weather variation, so we wanted to see if habituation to driving in clear, dry weather impacts the frequency of car accidents when the weather changes, as driving on the roads is much more dangerous when it starts to rain. This analysis would not only be helpful for us but for others - residents and vistors of California - to feel safer driving in California and to learn when to adapt one's driving in more hazardous conditions. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Prior Work\n",
    "\n",
    "Prior work has given a dataset comprised of real-time car accident data with variables including weather, severity of traffic impact, time of the accident, and the location of the accident [2,3]. The prediction we want to answer (whether rain and time of day are correlated with higher crash frequency) can directly use the weather and time variables from that data to help carry out our analysis. \n",
