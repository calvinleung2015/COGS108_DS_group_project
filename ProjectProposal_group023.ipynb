    "Analyzing car crash data in California to learn about whether there is a more dangerous time of day to be on the road is important for feeling safe while driving. If we can find a relationship between the variables that factor into a car crash and the severity of its impact on traffic, we can find a way to give California drivers a better knowledge of when to be more cautious while driving. \n",
